üèÜ Reese's 2023 Women's World Cup Analysis Tutorial
==================================================

Welcome Reese! Today you're going to become a soccer data scientist!
We'll analyze the 2023 Women's World Cup to find out which teams scored the most goals.

This tutorial will walk you through:
1. Loading the 2023 Women's World Cup data
2. Getting player statistics (goals and shots)
3. Grouping data by players and teams
4. Using pandas functions to analyze the data
5. Creating visualizations

Let's get started! üöÄ

5. ‚úÖ Create visualizations

**Now it's time to put this in your own reese.py file!**

Here's what you should do:
1. Copy the code sections you want to use
2. Paste them into your reese.py file
3. Customize the visualizations with your own style
4. Add your own analysis questions
5. Prepare to present your findings!

**Some ideas for your presentation:**
- Which team was most efficient (best shooting percentage)?
- Which players scored the most goals?
- How did your favorite team perform?
- What patterns do you see in the data?

**Remember:** You're now thinking like a real data scientist! üéâ
